# Java Ten Thousand

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year of trying I finally was able to create a Java source file with a total of 11,400 lines. This is what I am considering as a major accomplishments although these are useless codes. These are the codes that executes a total of 1900 functions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used Unix based system so if you are comfortable with this kinds of system you will be familiar with the console prompt. I have used Embeddable Compact Java(ECJ) to convert this JAVA source file into a class file. To install ECJ you have to install it by typing the command below and pressing the RETURN key.

```
rommeldominguez@linux~: apt-get install ecj
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After installing ECJ you will also need to install DX to convert class file into a Dalvik Executable or DEX.

```
rommeldominguez@linux~: apt-get install dx```
